Zerograph Protocol
==================

The Zerograph protocol is a line-based text protocol that allows batches of
requests and responses to be exchanged alternately between client and server.
It borrows a number of concepts from HTTP and REST including methods and
response status codes.

The protocol expects all communication between client and server to be
carried out over ZeroMQ sockets and the SNDMORE/RCVMORE flags may be used to
transmit both requests and responses over multiple frames.

Each client request consists of a batch of one or more requests on separate
lines. Each line consists of multiple terms separated by TAB characters
which, within this document, will be generally represented by simple
whitespace. Where potentially ambiguous, the symbol [->] will be used
instead.

The symbols >>> and <<< will also be used at the start of lines to indicate
client-to-server requests and server-to-client responses respectively. These
are not part of the messages themselves.

The following is an example of a request batch and the responses returned:

>>> POST node ["Person"] {"name":"Alice"}
>>> POST node ["Person"] {"name":"Bob"}
>>> POST rel /*Pointer*/0 /*Pointer*/1 KNOWS {"since":1999}

<<< 200 /*Node*/{"id":123,"labels":["Person"],"properties":{"name":"Alice"}}
<<< 200 /*Node*/{"id":124,"labels":["Person"],"properties":{"name":"Bob"}}
<<< 200 /*Node*/{"id":123,"labels":["Person"],"properties":{"name":"Alice"}}
<<< 200
